        <h1>Cybersecurity Fundamentals</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Core Security Principles</h2>
            <h3>The CIA Triad</h3>
            <p>The foundation of information security is built on three key principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that information and resources are available to those who need them when they need them.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Common Attack Vectors</h2>
            <p>Understanding how attacks occur is the first step in prevention:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.</li>
                <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Software specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.</li>
                <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle:</strong> Intercepting and potentially altering communications between two parties.</li>
                <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> Code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> Injecting malicious scripts into websites viewed by other users.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Defense Strategies</h2>
            <h3>Defense in Depth</h3>
            <p>This strategy uses multiple layers of security controls throughout an IT system, with the intent that if one defense fails, another will be in place to protect the system.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Defense Measures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Network security devices that monitor and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Antivirus/Anti-malware:</strong> Software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Process of encoding information to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device.</li>
                <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Granting or denying access rights to resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Patching:</strong> Updating software to fix security vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Backup and Recovery:</strong> Creating copies of data to restore after data loss.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Risk Management</h2>
            <p>Managing security risks involves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Finding and documenting potential threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Evaluating the likelihood and impact of threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Implementing controls to reduce risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Continuously tracking the effectiveness of controls.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>Security Best Practices</h2>
            <h3>For Individuals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use strong, unique passwords for each account</li>
                <li>Enable multi-factor authentication when available</li>
                <li>Keep software and operating systems updated</li>
                <li>Be cautious with email attachments and links</li>
                <li>Regularly back up important data</li>
                <li>Use secure networks and VPNs when connecting remotely</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>For Organizations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement formal security policies and procedures</li>
                <li>Conduct regular security awareness training</li>
                <li>Perform regular security assessments and penetration testing</li>
